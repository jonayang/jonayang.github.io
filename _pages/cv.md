Research Experience
-------
**Summer Researcher** | The O’Hern Group in Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science &ensp; Jul.2023 - Now

**Riverbed DEM Simulation, supervised by Prof. Corey O’Hern from Yale University** &ensp; CT, USA
* Simulated a 3D riverbed system using 400 bi-disperse particles with periodic boundary conditions, and studied
how the bed’s properties are changed due to different prestress history exerted by flow
* Optimized the simulation by introducing particle-particle elastic force, damping force, fluid’s dragging force, and
buoyancy force, to make the system more realistic
* Prepared different sedimented configurations of the bed, applied flow characterized by different Reynolds
numbers and Shield numbers, identified the critical combination of parameters to make a static riverbed mobile,
and reproduced Shield’s curve
* Prestress the beds with under-critical parameters to study new Shield’s curve again, and investigate the effect of
prestress history on bed’s anisotropy and resistance to applied flow (in progress)
* Utilize **C++** to develop the simulation, leveraging standard algorithms for DEM like *Verlet list* and *velocity Verlet
integration*

**Undergraduate Researcher \| Laboratory of Soft Matter Physics** &ensp; Apr. 2022 - Now

**Soft Matter Molecular Dynamics Simulation, supervised by Prof. Ning Xu from USTC** &ensp; Hefei, China
* Simulated the evolution of a system consisting of 256 short-range interacting particles using molecular dynamics methods, and investigated its macroscopic properties, such as pressure and moduli
* Determined the equilibrium state of the system with **Python** programming, solved the zero-temperature minimum energy configuration and the Jamming point by implementing the *FIRE* algorithm from an initial infinite temperature configuration, and calculated the critical scaling near the Jamming point
* Encapsulated the simulation code to obtain a simulation module for easy transplantation and reuse, optimized the algorithm using the *Verlet neighbor list*, and improved the computational efficiency for large-scale matrices using *Numpy* library functions
* Utilize the *Numba* module to pre-compile functions, thereby enhancing code execution efficiency by over 90%, with stabilization’s time cost drop from 10s to less than 0.8s

**Summer Researcher \| GREAT Summer Research Program of UC Davis** &ensp; Jul. 2022 - Aug. 2022

**Supervised by Prof. Dong Yu from UC Davis** &ensp; Online
* Constructed a model of solar cells using the finite element method, and successfully solved complex partial
differential equations regarding the potential and carrier distribution within the device.
* Utilized **COMSOL** to predict the impact of external bias voltage on the temporal evolution and spatial variation of the electric field and carrier density inside the device
* Simulated the ion migration in hybrid halide perovskite MAPbBr3, and evaluated its impact on the energy conversion efficiency
  
Course Project
-------
**Generation and Detection of Vortex Beam \| Team Leader and took charge of all the simulation work** &ensp; 

Oct. 2022 - Mar. 2023
* Studied the generation and propagation of vortex beams by reviewing the literature
* Used spatial light moderator to prepare vortex beams in modes with different topological charge numbers
* Designed optical path to observe optical vortex’s behavior, observed the interference phenomenon between optical
vortices and plane waves or spherical waves, and analyzed the geometric structure of the interference pattern
* Used **COMSOL** to visualize wave front of vortex beam and used Python to predict interference patterns and
compare them with experimental results
* **Achievement**: Received the Special Prize **(Top 10%)** in the USTC’s 18th University Physics Innovative Experimental Research Paper Competition for my paper titled "Generation of Vortex Beams"
