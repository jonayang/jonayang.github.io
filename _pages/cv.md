</div>

*	Developed Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation software for 3D riverbed system in C++
  * Improved the computational model by introducing frictional forces, particle-particle damping forces, fluid drag forces, and buoyancy forces to increase simulation fidelity
*	Carried out extensive simulations, and investigated how the bed’s properties are changed due to different prestress history exerted by flow
  *	Prepared different sedimented configurations of the bed and applied flow characterized by different Reynolds numbers and Shield numbers
  *	Identified the critical combination of parameters to make a static riverbed mobile, and reproduced Shield’s curve
  *	Preconditioned the bed with subcritical flow, and observed a directional strengthening effect, namely a shift of the bed’s mobilization onset and a change of mean grain velocity

*	Simulated the evolution of a system consisting of short-range interacting particles using Molecular Dynamics (MD) in Python
  *	Modularized the software for easy porting and reuse, optimized the algorithm using the Verlet neighbor list, and improved the computational efficiency for large-scale matrices using Numpy library functions
  *	Utilized the Numba module to pre-compile functions, thereby enhancing code execution efficiency by over 90%
*	Investigated the system’s macroscopic properties, such as pressure and moduli
  *	Determined the equilibrium state of the system and solved the zero-temperature minimum energy configuration and the Jamming
  *	Calculated the critical scaling near the Jamming point

Course Project
-------
**Generation and Detection of Vortex Beam \| Team Leader and took charge of all the simulation work** &ensp; 

Oct. 2022 - Mar. 2023
* Studied the generation and propagation of vortex beams by reviewing the literature
* Used spatial light moderator to prepare vortex beams in modes with different topological charge numbers
* Designed optical path to observe optical vortex’s behavior, observed the interference phenomenon between optical
vortices and plane waves or spherical waves, and analyzed the geometric structure of the interference pattern
* Used **COMSOL** to visualize wave front of vortex beam and used Python to predict interference patterns and
compare them with experimental results
* **Achievement**: Received the Special Prize **(Top 10%)** in the USTC’s 18th University Physics Innovative Experimental Research Paper Competition for my paper titled "Generation of Vortex Beams"
